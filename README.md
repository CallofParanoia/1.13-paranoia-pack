# 1.13.1 paranoia pack

Includes the following:
- [anti_enderman_grief](https://github.com/seadoggie01/anti_enderman_grief) by seadoggie01
This pack works by over-riding the 'minecraft:enderman_holdable' tag on every block. Only blocks tagged with such a tag can be held by enderman. As an added bonus, they don't look like they're holding anything in their hands while exploring your world either. They simply leave the blocks alone.
